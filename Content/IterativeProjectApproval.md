## Executive summary of the iterative proposal approach

Prior experience teaches that IT projects are better delivered when implemented in a phased manner. Each sequential phase delivering the next product version, implementing improved functionality and upgrades.

This proposal is to suggest to adopt a sequential approach for IT projects approval reflecting the different phases of the projects.  

For example, a project may make sequential Treasury Board Submissions reflecting different implementation phases.
