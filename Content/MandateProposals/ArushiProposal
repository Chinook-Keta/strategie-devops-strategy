## Vision
Towards strategic implementation of network architecture and management of digital products to fulfil government’s aspiration of delivering seamless digital services and prepare for future adoption of AI for autonomous decision-making and service delivery

## Priorities
> _Priorities for Transformation 2018-2019 … ESDC Service Strategy and Service Transformation Plan_
- Mobilizing resources to act a bimodal synchronizer for efficient running of low risk record/standard practices alongside high risk innovation practices
- Define government IT processes under “Pace-layered systems” to define and synergize different business capabilities, giving flexibility in governance design for innovation and response to technological changes
> “Mode 1 governance, then, is targeted at managing projects, while Mode 2 governance is about managing products.”

## Mandate
-	Adoption strategy for modern/futuristic technology, includes architecture design (enterprise, technical and solutions)
-	Direct research strategy and developmental efforts
-	Governing guidelines for use of AI and other autonomous decision-making technologies for service delivery 
-	(If suggesting a bimodal governance system) Act as the synchronizer for Mode 1 and Mode 2 governance practices (Mode 1: works for standardized business processes, Mode 2: works for implementing new ideas for differential or innovation)
-	
-	Innovation and Experimentation (In addition, the Strategic Framework identifies five themes that cut across the initiatives: Indigenous Reconciliation, Gender Impact and Equality, Vulnerable Groups, Policy-Service Integration, and Innovation and Experimentation.)
-
