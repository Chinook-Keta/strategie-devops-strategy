## Future role of ESDC
_Current mandate of ESDC_: The mission of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC), including the Labour Program and Service Canada, is to build a stronger and more inclusive Canada, to support Canadians in helping them live productive and rewarding lives and to improve Canadians’ quality of life  

_Current role of ESDC_: ESDC offers a range of programs and services such as seniors with basic income security, supports unemployed workers, helps students finance their post-secondary education and assists parents who are raising young children.   

_Preparing for the future_: Role of technology in human lives is redesigning the way we function daily. Global trends are fast changing the economic and political situations around the world – redistributing wealth, the nature of work and opportunities. Technology giants are changing human preferences and habits and opening up a box of completely new …   

Planning ahead will help Canada to respond and even stay ahead of the technological curve rather than react to the changes around us. In pursuit to continue to improve quality of life for Canadians, ESDC needs to manage these changes in society and be prepared towards unprecedented risks and disruption from global participants.    

To safeguard the needs of Canadians and continuously improve their quality of life, ESDC should anticipate the needs and challenges of the future. ESDC should be prepared to redesign its programs and services to stay ahead to meet the changing needs of Canadians. ESDC should keep an open mind towards radical transformation of its program and service delivery practices to keep pace with the technological advances and prepare Canadians to take on more centric roles in the digital economy.   

_Existing challenges in implementation_:
-	Existing governance policies and practices are proven for past programs and services. Due to shift in the software development and implementation practices, these policies and practices may not best suited for transformational technologies and initiatives  
-	Data and information sharing may need to be revisited to address current privacy and security debates  

## Vision of the branch
Strategic planning and implementation of technology-oriented service delivery to fulfil ESDC’s mission of building a stronger, competitive and more inclusive Canada, and improving Canadians’ quality of life 
~~Towards (i) strategic implementation of network architecture and management of digital products to fulfil government’s aspiration of transforming service delivery and (ii) preparation for future adoption of AI for autonomous decision-making and service delivery~~

## Priorities
- Governance focus include:
     *	Design principles for IT governance (_could introduce a new bimodal governance structure here_)
     *	Investment and priorities (_will help create a new category of exploratory projects_)
     *	Architecture (_prepare for the future, HDLC?_)
     *	Infrastructure use (_manage resources, coordinate between departments_)
     *	Client needs (_transform service delivery through adoption of advanced technologies_)
     *	Client engagement (_collect feedback and develop trust among citizen for use of data_)    

## Mandate
-	(POLICY) Providing oversight and guidance on governance processes for IT projects/initiatives 
-	(STRATEGY) Innovating service delivery and providing future direction/vision to ESDC digital services
-	(STRATEGY & PRIORITY) Direct research strategy and developmental efforts for DevOps
-	(POLICY) Governing guidelines for use of AI and other autonomous decision-making technologies for service delivery
-	(RESOURCE ALLOCATION) Mobilize resources to act as a bimodal synchronizer for efficient running of low risk record/standard practices alongside high risk innovation practices
-	(RISK AND COMPLIANCE) Secure use of information and data

## Activities
**_Policy and strategy development_**
-	Initiate new exploratory programs/projects and secure required funding/resources (_Who makes the submissions? Does each branch make their own submission? Does all submission go through CIO for approval first? Does IITB play a central role in project submissions? Within IITB is it Denis’s group that would do that?_)
-	Recommend policies and program guidelines for digital products/services (_Who approves or make decisions on policies?_)
-	Recommend suitable governance guidelines for exploratory programs/projects
-	Create 3-year plan for research and development strategy for DevOps (_How would DevOps be governed? Are they independent?_)
-	Ensure that ESDC’s technology programs/initiatives aligns with the themes of the strategic framework and priorities of the department
-	Develop adoption strategy for modern/futuristic technology, including architecture design (enterprise, technical and solutions)  

**_Program(s) Management_**
-	Continuously monitor technology trends to keep pace with technological development
-	Perform risk identification and risk management (modern and secure technology)
-	Network architecture design  

**_Resource Allocation_**
-	Allocate resources between various projects/initiatives 
-	Improve the sharing of information and resources between programs and across departments (How would bimodal work?)  

**_Organization Engagement_**
-	Coordinate with other departments to centralize use and allocation of IT resources 
-	Create/lead a working group (_invites members from across organizations_) for gathering information on prevailing IT challenges
-	Stimulate dialogues on the use of technology to improve services  

## Benefits of bimodal governance style
To keep pace with the digital habits of the citizens, ESDC needs to adopt technology at a much faster pace for service delivery. The IM and IT policies laid out by Treasury Board focuses on efficiency, stability and accuracy. Existing IM/IT governance style work well with projects associated with proven methodologies and technologies.   
However, it inherits some barriers for implementing exploratory projects. Exploratory projects are associated with innovating or experimenting to deliver a sudden transformation of business outcome. Redefining governance policies may be needed to promote:
-	Adoption of lean culture and continuous/agile delivery practices for churning out new products and services 
-	Initiate exploratory programs without sacrificing risk aversion governing nature 
-	Tight alignment of programs with the branch priorities 
-	Improves time-to-market and product evolution (Principle: "Fail fast")
-	Make innovation a sustainable process
