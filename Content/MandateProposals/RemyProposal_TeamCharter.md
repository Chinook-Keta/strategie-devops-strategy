## Preface

### History
Before the digital era, the business-IT relationship was based on a "business-led, IT-enabled" approach. In the digital era, 
the business-IT relationship is based on a "business- and IT-led, technology-enabled" approach. 
In the digital era, it's no longer about aligning business and IT. Instead, it's about surviving extreme 
competition and prospering by integrating business and IT into a single digital business strategy that 
addresses business and IT strategy as one.

ESDC's Service Transformation strategy aspires to advance five goals guided by five principles. In addition, 
TBS Digital Operations Strategic Plan of 2018-2020 sets the direction of the federal government along six themes. 
Policy Horizons Canada (Horizons) is conducting foresight that educates the whole of Government  on disruptive forces on 
the horizon. These strategies, plans, and foresights set aspirations for the Government of Canada services to be:

1. Service-oriented and user-centered
2. Open, collaborative, accessible, and accurate government services
3. Digital-first and digital enabled government
4. Efficient and effective
5. Responsive to citizens continuous change of expectations

In order for ESDC to move towards this vision of digital government and services, it will require becoming a much more 
responsive, resilient, and omnipresent digital service provider. IT Strategies are needed to enable ESDC to leverage 
technologies in order to move towards this target state vision.
