# Notes

## Mike Murphy

Hard to get commitment out of a committee

Just do it

CBSA, CRA and ESDC met

Stratosphere in June

## Jayson

Use VCS - Ops using VCS is a better indicator of maturity

Reduce Work in progress

## Question

We'll need to sell it to management

We'll need to explain/convince it to everyone with specifically addressing their concerns

## Mike Williamson

Note: Regarding the Dev/Operator model --> Use CI ##Skip (Need further details here since it may create commits to the config repo)

## Questions sessions

* Small events/meetups
* Could organize a bigger event but the target audience may be different (explaining, training others)
* Meet outside of work but also during workhours (not everyone is available after work)

Need communicating together (GCMessage, Slack, GitHub)
