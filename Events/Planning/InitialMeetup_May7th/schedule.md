Notes from previous discussion:

* September Event? Commit all to Stratosphere event? Every second week, bar; every other week, new dept venue? Private sector inclusion? Vendor inclusion?
* Guillaume and Mike, I wanted to play with this. We should all make cases for different perspectives and call it the 'fake debate'. Like, I could ask Guillaume and Mike questions, they answer opposing cases, then we ask the audience. Ex:
  * Should we invite private sector to these events?
    * What do you think Guillaume?
      * We should. Right now they're the experts, and we should pull from them.
    * What do you think Mike?
      * No private sector. They're just going to come and try to sell us new software. This is supposed to about improving government, not spending money
  * Audience, thoughts?
  * And we do something similar for each question above.
